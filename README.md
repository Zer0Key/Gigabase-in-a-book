- The base is based on the classic city block design but it's 200x200.
- Trains are 2-16-2
- Every block is isolated from the global robo-network.
- No belts were used at all, everything is done by either bots or trains.
- Nilaus' many-to-many train network is used for train scheduling.
- All builds are UPS optimized with inserter clocking.
- Two rail sets are included for the 200x200 layout because it isn't really compatible with the classic 100x100 layout.
- The 2-way set is just adapted from the widely spread book, the 4-way set is adapted from Paranoid Shark. 
- Alternative blueprints that are compatible with a 100x100 rail grid are included to make transition easier.
- Some generic blueprints to make designing and setting up new productions easier are included:
  - Self-balancing train un-loader and loader(essential with robot setup), many-to-many requester and provider and generic city blocks.
- There are no blueprints for: HUB, military science, modules, uranium processing, solar blocks or any other form of power production.
  - Those will follow eventually.
